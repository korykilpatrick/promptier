/**
 * @description
 * This TypeScript file serves as the background script (service worker) for the Promptier Chrome extension.
 * It runs continuously in the background, handling cross-script communication, authentication,
 * and server interactions as defined by Manifest V3 requirements.
 * 
 * Key features:
 * - Placeholder: Currently empty, awaiting implementation in later steps.
 * - Future Role: Will manage authentication, API communication, and message passing.
 * 
 * @dependencies
 * - None currently (dependencies like Clerk SDK will be added in Step 8).
 * 
 * @notes
 * - Compiled output will be placed in `dist/background.js` as referenced in the manifest.
 * - Uses service worker model per Manifest V3, meaning itâ€™s event-driven and not persistently running.
